## Version 2.1.0

This updated was made on 07.02.2024 to the UAE design system with the following changes.

 - An update was made to the alert component that ensures accessibility improvements and testing against [https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/](https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/) for a AA level rating. Moreover, improvements were made to the size of icons. Call to actions on alerts remains unchanged in the style.
 - Header navigation dropdown menu has been updated to remove a background colour on link items. This was suggested as something not to be forced. Link colors will change on hover and underline will be added, however background colour changes are left as a choice.

Furthermore;

 1. Compatibility testing was carried out. There are no breaking changes.
 2. There are no changes to class names and structure.
